how to interpret cor(dummies) for multicollinearity

The cor(dummies) function in R computes the correlation matrix between the dummy variables created from your categorical predictors (e.g., min_inspections and establishment_type). Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, with values ranging from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to +1 (perfect positive correlation). A correlation of 0 means no linear relationship.

How to interpret the correlation matrix:
Correlation Coefficients:

+1: Perfect positive correlation. As one variable increases, the other increases in a perfectly linear way.
-1: Perfect negative correlation. As one variable increases, the other decreases in a perfectly linear way.
0: No correlation. No linear relationship exists between the two variables.
Close to 1 or -1: A strong positive or negative linear relationship, which might indicate potential multicollinearity.
Look for high correlations:

If you find values that are close to 1 or -1 (e.g., above 0.9 or below -0.9), it indicates a strong linear relationship between the corresponding dummy variables.
In the context of dummy variables, high correlations usually suggest that one or more categories of the original factor are redundant and could cause multicollinearity.
Example Interpretation:
Suppose you have a dataset with the following dummy variables for establishment_type and min_inspections:

r
Copy code
cor(dummies)
This might return a matrix like:

python
Copy code
                         establishment_typeFast Food establishment_typeFormal Dining ...
establishment_typeFast Food           1                     0.2  
establishment_typeFormal Dining       0.2                   1
...
If establishment_typeFast Food and establishment_typeFormal Dining have a correlation of 0.2, this is low and doesn't indicate multicollinearity.
If you had a correlation of 0.9 or higher between, say, establishment_typeFast Food and another dummy variable, it would indicate multicollinearity, and you might consider removing one of the correlated variables.
What to do if you find high correlations:
Identify Redundant Variables:

If you have two or more dummy variables with correlations close to 1 or -1, one of them may be redundant.
Remove Redundant Variables:

You can remove one of the correlated dummy variables from the model to address the issue of multicollinearity.
Re-run the Model:

After removing the highly correlated variables, re-run the model and check if the multicollinearity issue persists.
Example of a High Correlation Matrix:
r
Copy code
# Example matrix output
cor(dummies)

# Result:
#                      establishment_typeFast Food establishment_typeFormal Dining ...
# establishment_typeFast Food           1                     0.9  
# establishment_typeFormal Dining       0.9                   1
# ...
In this case, you would remove either establishment_typeFast Food or establishment_typeFormal Dining from the model.

Summary:
Check correlation values for all dummy variables.
High correlations (close to 1 or -1) indicate multicollinearity.
Remove one of the highly correlated variables to address the issue.
