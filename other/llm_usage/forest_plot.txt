A forest plot is a graphical representation of the results of multiple statistical studies or models, often used to visualize the estimates of effect sizes (like odds ratios, hazard ratios, or regression coefficients) and their confidence intervals. The plot typically displays the point estimates with horizontal lines representing the confidence intervals, and each study or model is plotted as a separate row, making it easy to compare results across studies or models.

To create a forest plot in R using the broom package, you typically follow these steps:

Fit your model (e.g., linear, logistic, etc.).
Use broom to tidy the model output.
Create the forest plot using a plotting package like ggplot2.
Hereâ€™s a general example using a linear regression model:

Example: Forest Plot with broom and ggplot2
r
Copy code
# Install necessary packages if not installed
# install.packages("broom")
# install.packages("ggplot2")

library(broom)
library(ggplot2)

# Fit a linear model (example model)
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp + qsec, data = mtcars)

# Tidy the model output
tidy_model <- tidy(model)

# Forest plot
ggplot(tidy_model, aes(x = estimate, y = term, xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbarh(height = 0.2) +
  labs(x = "Estimate", y = "Predictor") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10))
Steps Explained:
Fit the model: We fit a linear regression model to predict mpg based on variables like wt, hp, and qsec in the mtcars dataset.
Tidy the output: The tidy() function from the broom package takes the model output and converts it into a tidy data frame with columns like term (predictor names), estimate (the estimated coefficients), conf.low, and conf.high (confidence interval bounds).
Create the forest plot: We use ggplot2 to create a horizontal plot where each predictor (term) is plotted along the y-axis, and the coefficient estimates are plotted along the x-axis. The error bars represent the confidence intervals.
You can modify this code to suit other models (like logistic regression or mixed models), and the broom package provides similar functions like glance() for model summaries and augment() for working with individual observations.
