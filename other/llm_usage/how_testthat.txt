To test that there are only 44 types of food establishments in your data using the testthat package, you can write a unit test that checks if the number of unique types of establishments matches the expected value.

Steps:
Install and Load testthat: If you haven't already, you need to install and load the testthat package.
Write the Test: Use the test_that() function to create a test that validates the number of unique food establishment types.
Hereâ€™s an example of how to do this:

1. Install and Load testthat
If you don't have testthat installed, you can install it via install.packages():

r
Copy code
# Install testthat if not already installed
install.packages("testthat")

# Load the testthat package
library(testthat)
2. Define the Test
Assuming your data frame is called df and the column with food establishment types is called establishment_type, you can write the test as follows:

r
Copy code
# Example of a test to check if there are exactly 44 types of food establishments
test_that("There are exactly 44 types of food establishments", {
  # Get the number of unique types in the establishment_type column
  num_types <- length(unique(df$establishment_type))
  
  # Test if there are 44 unique types
  expect_equal(num_types, 44)
})
Explanation:
test_that(): This function is used to define a test case.
unique(df$establishment_type): This returns the unique values in the establishment_type column.
length(): This returns the number of unique values (types of establishments).
expect_equal(): This checks if the number of unique types equals 44.
3. Run the Test
You can run the test by calling it directly in your R script or by using the testthat framework in an RStudio project. For example, in an R script, simply running the code above will execute the test.

4. Interpret the Results
If the number of unique food establishment types is indeed 44, the test will pass.
If it is not 44, the test will fail, and testthat will give an error message indicating the expected value (44) and the actual value.
Example Output on Success:
r
Copy code
> test_that("There are exactly 44 types of food establishments", {
+   num_types <- length(unique(df$establishment_type))
+   expect_equal(num_types, 44)
+ })
No output means the test passed successfully.

Example Output on Failure:
r
Copy code
Error: `expect_equal` failed
* Expected: 44
* Actual: 46
This shows that there are actually 46 types of food establishments in your dataset, not 44, and the test would fail.

Summary
Using testthat, you can easily validate that the number of unique food establishment types in your dataset is exactly 44 by comparing it with the expected value using expect_equal(). This helps ensure your data meets expected conditions for testing or further analysis.
